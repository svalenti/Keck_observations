,,,,,,,Night starts at 10:27 UTC,,
2013fs,n,,,,Try to detect interaction; good candidate; If we see something get another spectrum and skip 2018dfy,20m,10:30,10:50,Y
2017eaw,y,~450,18.8,yes,Beautiful LC - caught all features; In the middle of Gemini sequence - low priority,10m,10:55,11:05,Y
2017ivv,n,,19.4,,nebular spectrum requested on SNEX from J. Anderson; possibly single SN paper,15m,11:10,11:25,Y
2018dfy,n,,18-18.5?,,young - 30d old; not well followed in SNEX,10m,11:30,11:40,Y
2016iks,n,,20.85,,Ia-CSM,20m,11:45,12:05,Y
2013ej,n,,,,,20m,12:10,12:30,Y
2017gmr,y,~340,19,yes,Beautiful LC - caught all features,10m,12:35,12:45,Y
2017gaw,y,~365,23,yes,If this is actually faint - maybe observe at high priority,4x20,12:50,14:10,Y
2017fbu,y,~405,22.2,yes,5d non-detection; excellent photometry; possibly only missing the rise/peak; We just triggered LCO photometry,3x20,14:15,15:15,Y

Backup Targets,,,,,,,,,
2018coq,,?,18.75,,No good non-detection date,,,,n
2017iit,,~250,??,?,2d non-detection; really funky LC - hard to tell what phases we caught; hard to tell what mag it would be today,,,,n
2017hcc,,315,17,,2d non-detectionIIn followed by ePESSTO; PESSTO and LCO LC,,,,n

Rejected Targets,,,,,,,,,
2018cow,,,19.5,,at airmass > 3,15-30m?,10:30,11:00,
2018gj,,~215d,19.85,yes,"6d non-detection; spectroscopy, nice LC although may have missed the fall - but it is constrained; Never gets above airmass=3; If 2017gaw needs whole time, remove this target",15-30m?,11:05,11:35,
2017hbj,,~320,21?,?,"10d non-detection; weird LC - starts like IIL, transitions to IIP, no fall from plateau - smooth transition to Ni tail - only 1 spectrum; too far south",,,,
2017hpi,y,~300,20,yes,4d non-detection; late LCO monitoring but really nice LC - incl. fall and Ni tail; not up,15m,,,
2017ipa,,~270,?,?,Poor constraint on explosion but PESSTO has spectroscopy. 150 days of photometry (started late) but need difference imaging to evaluate; too low at sunrise airmass > 3,,,,
2017ivh,,>250,19.7,yes,No constraint on explosion epoch but spectra and really nice LC after; still monitoring; sets too early,,,,
2017jgi,,,,,K2 Sne- apparently has good data - not in SNEX; Not up,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
2017gww,,~345,<23????,No,"Faint - terrible photometry, missed key features; do not observe",,,,
2018cuf,,,,,Southern target,,,,
2018ecf,,,,,Southern target,,,,
2012ec,n,,,,Try to detect interaction; poor candidate; abnormal IIP,20m,14:40,15:00,
