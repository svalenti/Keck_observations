Notes:
* We had to focus manually because we were in foul weather position (break into two parts and use internal lamps)
* Utilities --> Run focusloop (R+Internal)
* Utilities --> Analyze focusloop
* This yielded a funny looking focus map on chip1. We switched to single amp mode and retook the data. Observing the whole night with amp B only
