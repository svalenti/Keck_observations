Red side hangs: SA can fix it

Observation Log:
Test exposures b/c Red side crashed
Focus - 7 each side

We saw a vertical line of points on the red side. This is because the focus mechanism didn't move
This happens sometimes when you restart the software. SA fixed it and we re-ran the focus

Repeat red focus
