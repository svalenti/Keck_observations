2019uo - last chance to get a spectrum before sets. Fast evolving  
2017ivh - Keck spectrum from Feb. Great target
2017ivv - Low priority - we don't have good constraint on the explosion. Keck spectrum from August. v. weak Ha. Rising - check that we can observe it with pointing limitations
2018gj - great object, we just triggered LCO - check that we got data (Isabelle)
2018aoq - we should do this - we already have a Keck spectrum from Dec
